/**
 * Classes that handle the <i>net.minecraft.server</i> classes. These have the same name as those
 * found within the NMS package to kept things consistent. These can be used in place of NMS to
 * avoid version-specific classes. These have more detail and require knowledge of how the NMS
 * packets work. The {@link PacketManager} contains common NMS packets that are used for many
 * plugins and servers.
