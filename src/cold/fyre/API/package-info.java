 * Contains a vast collection of classes and objects that can be used to make plugin creation easier and more efficient.
 * This also supports via specific functions and methods such as NMS classes and objects. The classes that are used here
 * are able to be used on most versions that are above the Minecraft Version 1.8. Keep in mind that not all functions found
 * within this collection may be compatible on all versions, but majority should be.
 * <p>
 * There are two different types of handling for NMS packets. The two ways are either using the {@link PacketManager}, which
 * provides simple functions that are commonly used with many plugins. All but a few of these functions will be accessible and
 * usable on all versions from 1.8 to the latest version. Please check THIS plugin's version to see what Minecraft Version the
 * functions and methods.
 * <br><br>
 * For each packet, there is a class that can be used that enables it to be used on each of the Minecraft Version it is supported.
 * Note that the not all functions of the NMS will be available via this plugin's class, only those that are either commonly used
 * or easy to convert into the correct data.
